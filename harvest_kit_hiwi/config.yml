    # The way harvest is set up is that there is one *project* entirely dedicated for the hiwi time tracking
    # you need to find out the ID of that project and insert it here. The program will use this to only
    # retrieve the time entries related to that project.
    # To find out this project ID use the "show_projects" command that ist also provided by this package!

# CONFIGURE HOW THIS PROGRAM SHOULD FUNCTION
function:
    # If active, all the harvest time entries for the same day will be merged into a single entry for the
    # of the final table of the document. Durations will be added up and descriptions are concatenated.
    # This is strongly encouraged due to the limited size of the document.
    merge_daily: true

    # If active, all additional working hours which exceed the given monthly working time will be clipped
    # aka discarded so that the documentation comes out to the perfect amount.
    # Otherwise, the additional hours will be added via carry over to the next month

    # If active, working time on holidays / sundays will automatically be fixed, which means that they will
    # be moved to the next available date which is not a holiday.

    # automatically add just the right amount of leave for every month such that all leave is fully
    # utilized.
